# Summer-Work

## Travel and Tourism
*Benefits:* Travelling to different locations can show the geographical ecology of the environment and detect objects that you may have never seen before. It can help detect shopping items or food so that you can try it out next time.

*Limitations:* May not be 100% accurate at all times as they have limited data

*Risks:* Could be giving false information about certain places

## Gaming and Entertainment
*Benefits:* Could help improve augmented reality games and create games like pokemon using the physical world as a map. Could also detect movements of objects like birds or football players, and mimic that data to create realistic games

*Limitations:* The lack of fast detection causes games to look slow, usually they run at 120 fps but this system only runs at 50fps

*Risks:* Privacy risks as you could be using it to spy on people 

## Education and Learning 
*Benefits:* Able to learn things you have never seen before, helps monitor the poeple in the class and identify if there are any missing or banned items

*Limitations:* May not give correct information about certain subjects or topics

*Risks:* Coudl be affecting the privacy of students and could be used at as cheat tool for homework or tests


## Transport and Navigation
*Benefits:* It is possible to create self driving vehicles or improved auto-pilots. Self driving trains could reduce the demand for train drivers, making them more useful in other areas of the world. It can also distinguish people and calculate the amount of people passing through an area at specific times of the day, providing data so that people know when the busiest times are or when shops should be open. 

*Limitations:* May not be fast enough to detect fast moving objects, such as cars travelling at 60mph. This would cause a delay for the system to use breaks for vehicles, possibly crashing into the vehicle infront and causing damage. The system may not detect all the people in an area either

*Risks:* It may also accidently detect fast moving objects such as a tennis ball in which it would then suddenly pull the breaks for the car, not giving enough time for a car behind to break and causing a crash. 

## Medicine and Healthcare
*Benefits:* Able to identify small cancerous cells or detect illness through physical symptoms of the patient

*Limitations:* Not high enough resolution to idenitfy such small cells, speed may be  reduced with smaller objects

*Risks:* Could give incorrect information about specific medicine or cells, heavily reliant on it.
